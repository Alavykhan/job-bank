                    <p><span className='font-semibold'>Answer:</span> Context API is a process where data shared in every component without passing props manually. When you are working in the medium or large application where you have to share the data in different component but parent component is very far from the child component that time you can setup the props in the central area so that every component can use it easily and pass the data from API.</p>
